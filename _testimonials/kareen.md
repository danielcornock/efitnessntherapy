I’ve never had sports massage before but after a series of car accidents in short sucession I was impressed with how this has released tension and pain in my lower back. I’m very happy with the approach Ellaine takes, individual, careful and I feel relaxed and released after each session. The problem I’ve had looks like It will be resolved in a few weeks. Thanks to Ellaine’s patience I’m on the mend.
