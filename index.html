                            <p>Hi, firstly, thank you for visiting my website.</p>

                            <p>Now allow me to introduce myself, I began my career in health fitness wellbeing and physical therapy in 2002 where after 10 years in the body building industry, first as a personal fitness regime for myself, then as a competitor in local natural bodybuilding competitions where after a few years the industry began to change and leaned more toward fitness. I then went on to obtain a qualification in YMCA exercise to music level III. I went on to teach fitness classes locally in community halls and parks in the summer months. </p>
                            
                            <p>An opportunity of a lifetime came along after four years in the fitness industry and I made a career change with spanned 10 years. During this time I continued to study and expand my knowledge of the human anatomy to became a qualified Sports Rehabilitation Therapist specialising in soft tissue manipulation and also and I also taught classes as an unarmed defence instructor fitness instructor skill I had already acquired in order to supplement my studies. </p>
                            
                            <p>After 10 years I slowly drifted back into the field of fitness and physical therapy, which brings me to where I am today. I presently work at an established non profit making Health club where I am a Wellbeing advisor and PT and In my own time I conduct sport therapy sessions on the premises for patrons of the club as well as my own clientele portfolio.</p>
                            
                            <p>I thoroughly enjoy what I do. I always have a satisfying day when I treat clients who come to me with sometimes chronic injuries and go away with restored mobility and pain free. </p>
                            
                            <p>I have always been fascinated by how the human body works what it does and its capabilities. We are all unique and I truly believe the body is a temple. Take care of it and it will do the same for you.</p>

                            <p>The thought of sports massage was worse that the reality. I presumed Ellaine was going to apply much more pressure the second time around for my treatment sessions. But to my surprise if found I was perfectly able to cope with it with a bit of controlled breathing and itâ€™s so worth it, my legs are feeling so much looser and lighter. </p>
